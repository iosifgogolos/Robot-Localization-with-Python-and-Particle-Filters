# Robot-Localization-with-Python-and-Particle-Filters
In this project, we tackle a real-world problem in robotics: localization. We will be simulating a robot that can move around in an unknown environment, and have it discover its own location using only a terrain map and an elevation sensor.  We will encounter some of the classic challenges that make robotics difficult: noisy sensor data, and imprecise movement. We will tackle these challenges with an artificial intelligence technique called a particle filter.  By the end of this project, we coded a particle filter from scratch using Python and numpy.
